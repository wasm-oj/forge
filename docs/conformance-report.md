# Forge contract 1 conformance and efficiency report

Forge contract 1 is the first formal compatibility boundary and includes the
complete compiler, runner, deterministic virtual-clock, metering, resource,
judge, and library behavior. The current preregistered evidence is maintained
under the single [contract 1 conformance experiment](../experiments/forge-contract-1-conformance/).

<!-- forge-conformance-summary:start -->
This report records real local server and browser runs on 2026-07-20
(Asia/Taipei). The canonical matrix is generated from independent append-only
evidence records under `wasm-oj-forge-v1`; it is not a synthetic estimate.
<!-- forge-conformance-summary:end -->

The canonical JSON matrix records the exact source-tree and specification
digests for both raw inputs. Publication rejects records that do not match each
other or the source and specification present at publication time.

## Recorded contract

- Forge contract 1 jointly versions compiler, runner, determinism, metering,
  artifacts, judge specifications, caches, and conformance schemas. There are
  no independent subsystem contract counters.
- Pinned content: Clang 22 for C17/C++20, Rust 1.91.1-dev, Go 1.26.5,
  CPython 3.14.6, TypeScript 7.0.2, and QuickJS-ng 0.15.1.
- Runtime: the shared Rust runtime core uses Wasmer 7.2.0 and WASIX 0.702.0;
  browser compiler and package execution use `@wasmer/sdk` 0.10.0.
- Weighted meter model `weighted` under Forge contract 1, with opcode weights
  adapted from Binaryen's optimizer cost model and preserved for WARK 0.3
  compatibility.
- Every server case performs two uncached builds and three deterministic runs.
  A pass requires equal build digests, the declared output/termination, and an
  identical deterministic transcript across all three runs.
- Empty-program baselines were recalibrated across all 18
  language/target/optimization profiles and five seeds. All 90 executions
  produced seed-independent raw costs; a separate nine-profile production
  smoke confirmed `net = 0` and `raw = baseline` for every release profile.

## Browser/server conformance

<!-- forge-conformance-matrix:start -->
All 21 declared language/target cases passed independently in
`server-native` and `browser-wasmer-js`. The canonical comparison contains zero
mismatches: every artifact digest and every deterministic transcript field is
identical across hosts. Timing remains observational and is excluded from
compatibility.

The default panel contains all 21 execution cases shown above: the nine
language/target profiles plus deterministic filesystem, multi-file I/O,
write-time VFS quota, denied capability, and language-level virtual-clock
probes. The opt-in full panel adds the header-heavy C++ standard-library case.
The new canonical header path now selects the toolchain-admitted release PCH;
a real native Wasmer smoke on the current source compiled it in about 4.1
seconds and executed successfully. That targeted attempt is retained as
append-only raw evidence, but it is not merged into the 21-case browser/server
matrix above until a new full two-host publication is collected.

Python has the largest fixed runtime cost, but normalization removes only its
measured empty-program startup. Parsing/loading the submission, deterministic
API use, input, allocation, I/O, and user code remain charged. Raw cost and the
complete opcode map remain in every transcript.
