# Changelog

All notable changes to WASM-OJ are recorded here. Releases follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) and the contract/package versioning policy in
[the versioning policy](docs/versioning.md).

## 0.2.2 - 2026-09-10

- Fixed browser toolchain execution under strict Content Security Policy and kept isolated
  Wasmer runtime preparation alive until it completes.
- Aligned client execution with native language semantics, including Java compilation through
  TeaVM WasmGC, QuickJS standard-library support, and Python 3.14.7.
- Preserved deterministic execution by removing host-clock mode and corrected native Linux
  parity checks to use file-backed standard input.
- Fixed npm tarball publication paths and added release retries from existing immutable tags.
- Kept the execution contract at version 2. The seven code packages move together to 0.2.2;
  independently versioned toolchain packages remain at 0.2.0.

## 0.2.1 - 2026-09-08

- Replaced managed collection APIs with repository-authored catalogs. `wasm-oj.json` and an
  exact Git commit now define catalog content; Organizer exports repository parsers and static
  validation instead of managed collection parsers.
- Replaced the CLI collection validation/publication/activation workflow with `woj organizer
  catalog connect` and `catalog sync`. Problem commands use stable problem IDs, and rejudge
  commands select commit-to-commit targets. Existing CLI integrations must update their commands.
- Added declarative contest rules and Prompt Program repository authoring. Organizer collection
  builds validate and package deployable judge data without executing reference solutions.
- Fixed redirected standard input/output handling in the shared runtime and stdin consumption
  in QuickJS execution; refreshed the browser runtime and its pinned content identity.
- Kept the WASM-OJ execution contract at version 2. The seven code packages move together to
  0.2.1; independently versioned toolchain assets remain at 0.1.0.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-20

- Replaced the experimental contract with the breaking WASM-OJ contract 2 boundary.
- Split the public API into contracts, core, browser, server, organizer, CLI, and SDK, plus six
  independently versioned toolchain packages.
- Added the local-first `woj` CLI as the single Student and Organizer command-line interface.
  Local commands use only bytes already on the machine and `--offline` rejects every
  network-capable command before dispatch; remote commands authorize through a browser-approved
  device flow and keep the resulting token only in the operating system credential store, with
  no plaintext file fallback. Exit codes 0 through 7 are part of its public contract.
- Removed the `wasm-oj-collection` executable from `@wasm-oj/organizer`. `woj organizer
  collection` replaces it, and the packaged GitHub Action now invokes `@wasm-oj/cli`.
- Added the Java WASI toolchain package built on TeaVM and the OpenJDK class library. Hosts
  install it explicitly like every other toolchain; Java is a compiler capability and is not yet
  a problem submission language.
- Made browser and server toolchain sources explicit and digest-verified; removed implicit
  CDN, directory-search, and compatibility fallback paths.
- Reorganized UI code into reusable primitives and domain feature modules.
- Renamed product-facing APIs, schemas, protocols, binaries, storage identities, and
  operational configuration to WASM-OJ. The GitHub repository path remains unchanged.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-19

Initial experimental release of the retired monolithic package.

- Browser and server compiler hosts for C, C++, Rust, Go, Python, JavaScript,
  and TypeScript targeting `wasip1`, with the supported C/C++ `wasix` profile.
- Deterministic Wasmer runner with weighted metering, normalized startup cost,
  virtual clocks and randomness, memory/output/VFS quotas, and replay bundles.
- Multi-file judging, special checkers, interactive judging, dependency locks,
  content-addressed incremental compilation, and unified browser storage.
- Submission-scoped operations, stable errors and observations, browser runtime
  driver plug-ins, and one-line server initialization.
- Cross-host conformance evidence covering 21 language, target, filesystem,
  capability, and deterministic-time cases.
